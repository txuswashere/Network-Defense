		- Position of mobile nodes should be verified with the aim of referring one physical node with one vehicle identity only, which means one vehicle cannot have two or more identities
		- Data privacy should be implemented; therefore, the user’s account or identity should be kept protected and hidden from other users
		- Data authentication should be performed to confirm the identity of the original source node
		- Maintain data confidentiality using symmetric key encryption
		- Implement a strong password policy requiring a password at least 8–10 characters long with a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters
		- Use CAPTCHA and account lockout policy methods to avoid brute-force attacks
		- Use devices made by manufacturers with a track record of security awareness

# Module 10: Cryptography and PKI 
- Cryptographic Techniques 
	- Types of Encryption
		- Symmetric Encryption
			- Advantages:
				- It is easy to encrypt and decrypt a message
				- It is faster than asymmetric encryption
				- It is used to encrypt large amounts of data
			- Disadvantages:
				- The communicating parties need to share the key used for transmitting the data
				- Unauthorized access to a symmetric key leads to the compromise of data at both ends
		- Asymmetric Encryption
			- Advantages:
				- It is more secure than symmetric encryption.
				- There is no need to distribute the keys.
			- Disadvantages:
				- It takes a longer processing time than symmetric encryption since it involves various combinations of secret keys and public keys.
				- Various complex algorithms involved in the
